# final-project-akp18 - Online Marketplace on Blockchain

### Description: Create an online marketplace that operates on the blockchain.
 
There are a list of stores on a central marketplace where shoppers can purchase goods posted by the store owners.

The central marketplace is managed by a group of administrators. 
Admins allow store owners to add stores to the marketplace. 
Store owners can manage their storeâ€™s inventory and funds. 
Shoppers can visit stores and purchase goods that are in stock using cryptocurrency. 
 
#### Admin Features 
<ul>
<li>An administrator opens the web app.</li>  
<li>The web app reads the address and identifies that the user is an admin, showing them admin only functions, such as managing store owners.</li>
<li>An admin adds an address to the list of approved store owners, so if the owner of that address logs into the app, they have access to the store owner functions.</li>

</ul>
